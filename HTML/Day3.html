       <h1>MY STORY</h1>
    <p>My name is Naveena and I have completed my BSc in Information Technology.  
     I did an internship in frontend development where I learned about web technologies and complete one project named Responsive furniture website.
     In my final year, I developed a web-based chatbot project called <i><b>InfoHive</b></i>.  
     This chatbot was created to answer common college-related queries and I implemented it using PHP and MySQL database connectivity.  
     I look forward to exploring advanced areas like Artificial Intelligence or Cybersecurity in the future.</p>
